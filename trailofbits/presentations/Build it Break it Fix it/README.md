# Build it Break it

We created a competition where students design and implement secure programs, and identify bugs in each other’s programs. We’ll talk about the design of the competition, the data we’ve gathered from executing the competition, our plans for future competitions, and what the data is telling us about software security, programming languages, education, and software development.
