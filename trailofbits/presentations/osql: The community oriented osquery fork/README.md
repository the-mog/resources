# osql: The community oriented osquery fork

osql is a community-oriented fork of osquery. Its goals are making the development process more open and predictable, being responsive in reviewing and accepting community contributions, and maintaining the communityâ€™s confidence and direct participation in the osquery project. In this talk, we discuss how we intend to maintain a successful community fork of a major open-source project.
