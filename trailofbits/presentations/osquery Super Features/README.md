## Osquery Super Features

In this talk, we reviewed a user feature wishlist gathered from interviews with five Silicon Valley tech teams who use osquery. From these, we identified Super Features - features that would fundamentally improve the value proposition of osquery. We explained how these developments could transform osqueryâ€™s power in technical organizations. Finally, we walked through the high-level development plans for making these Super Features a reality.
