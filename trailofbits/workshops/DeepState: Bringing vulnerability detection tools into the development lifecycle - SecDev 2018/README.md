# DeepState: Bringing vulnerability detection tools into the development lifecycle - SecDev '18

We presented a 3 hour workshop on our unit test-like interface for fuzzing and symbolic execution, [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate), at SecDev '18. The event served as a basic introduction to DeepSate and an opportunity for attendees to work on sample problems.
