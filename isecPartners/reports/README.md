## Public Reports

As part of [our work with the Open Technology
Fund](https://isecpartners.github.io/2013/10/14/open-tech-fund-report-release.html),
some of the audits we produce are publicly available in full. These documents
have not been redacted in any way, excepting removing personal contact
information of individuals involved. While the majority of the work we do is
private, we're happy to be able to both help projects that promote human
rights and open societies and showcase the type of work we conduct day-in and
day-out.
