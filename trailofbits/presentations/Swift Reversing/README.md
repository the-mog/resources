# Swift Reversing

## Abstract

At WWDC 2014, Apple introduced Swift, their revolutionary new programming language for the future. Swift promises unapologetic optimization, outstanding speed, and best-in-class language features. Swift is sleek, stunning, and already the most loved language on StackOverflow. Up until now, no reverse engineer has dissected the language or the artifacts it produces and presented their findings.
 
However, since an hour long presentation discussing Swift class structure and string layouts would be painfully boring, this talk actually presents a systematic approach to binary reverse engineering new foreign ABIs using Swift as a case study. Iâ€™ll present approaches for identifying control structures and flow, recovering class layouts, mapping machine code patterns to higher level language constructs, and more! This presentation will leave you with the knowledge and confidence needed to take on any ABIs -- maybe even Haskell.
