Improving PyPI's security with Two Factor Authentication
========================================================

Since March, Trail of Bits has worked with the PSF to implement and land major security
improvements in Warehouse, the codebase that drives PyPI. This talk will cover just one of those
improvements: the addition of two factor authentication to user logins.
Attendees will learn about the technical details of two factor schemes, the security properties
they can (and can not) provide, and the process for making major changes to core Python
infrastructure.
