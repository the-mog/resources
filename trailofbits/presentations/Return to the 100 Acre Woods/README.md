# Return to the 100 Acre Woods

In 2016 Stefan gave a talk about how everything in appsec was broken and there was no hope for the future. In the intervening years, Stefan has worked in adversary simulation, formal & program analysis, as well as even more threat modeling. This talk is an answer to the problems he presented in 2016, as well as why everything is still broken.
