## Getting started with osquery

Take a journey under the hood of Cb LiveOps, into the underlying open source project osquery. Cb LiveOps leverages osquery to provide easy, single pane of glass osquery functionality across your entire organization so you can get immediate answers for your IT, Compliance, and Security teams. Learn how osquery works, how it can be extended and how you can contribute. This session includes a live code exercise and case study from Trail of Bits where you'll learn how to use the rich library of existing queries, as well as how write effective queries using the existing osquery tables.
