Going sicko mode on the Linux Kernel
====================================

This talk discusses the concept of faults as an abstract bug class, as well
as the usage of fault injection for both software resiliency and vulnerability
research purposes. It introduces [KRF](https://github.com/trailofbits/krf),
a kernel-space randomized fault injector developed at Trail of Bits,
as a practical example of injecting faulty syscalls into user-space programs.
