# Reproducibility License 1.1.0

## Acceptance

In order to get any license under these terms, you must
agree to their rules.  Those rules are both obligations
under your agreement and conditions to all your licenses.

## <a id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</a>

These terms license you _only_ for the following purposes:

1.  You may reproduce published research results that the
    licensor achieved using this software.

2.  You may produce and reproduce research results of your
    own, and of others, only for noncommercial purposes.

These terms do _not_ license you for any other purpose,
such as producing or reproducing new research results for
commercial purposes.

## Copyright

The licensor grants you a copyright license for
the software.  That license covers everything you
might do with the software that would infringe the
licensor's copyright in it, for the purposes permitted
in [Reproducibility](#reproducibility).  That license
does _not_ cover making changes or new work based on the
software or removing this license from the software.

## Patent

The licensor grants you a patent license for the software.
That license covers patent claims the licensor can
license, or becomes able to license, that you would have to
infringe to use the software for the purposes permitted in
[Reproducibility](#reproducibility).  That license does
_not_ cover selling the software.

## Patent Defense

If you or any affiliated company makes any written claim
alleging that the software infringes or contributes to
infringement of a patent, your patent license under these
terms ends immediately.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer
any licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not
imply any other licenses.

## Reliability

The licensor may not revoke any license under these terms.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is,
without any warranty or condition, and the licensor will
not be liable to anyone for any damages related to this
software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
