,,access controls,med,medium,medium,1,0,,CS Sev -> ToB Sev & Diff:,
,,access controls,low,low,high,0,1,,"CS assigns a severity and likelihood (inverse of difficulty) to issues in the Security section. In those cases, I generally deferred to their categorization unless I was aware of a similar issue of ours that was categorized differently",
,trust,missing logic,med,low,low,0,0,,Trust issues tended to overwhelmingly relate to access control issues due to the nature of those issues,
,,access controls,med,low,low,0,1,,"Design issues tended to be code quality, but some higher severity issues cropped up here as well",
